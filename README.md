:grapes: Hello, I am poisongrape

I'm just a regular ol' software developer who is into web development.

I love the front-end because I'm a visual kind of guy. ðŸ§¡\
I hate the front-end because we're buried under tons of libraries nowadays ðŸ˜›

You can usually find me trying to get off my lazy butt to do something meaningful
...or playing games and watching anime.
